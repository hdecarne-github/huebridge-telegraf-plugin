This [Telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf) input plugin gathers stats from [Hue Bridge](https://www.philips-hue.com/) devices. It uses the device's [CLIP API](https://developers.meethue.com/develop/hue-api-v2/) interface to retrieve the stats. Light status as well as Motion sensor data is retrieved.
